But with the Republican position more intractable than ever, calls for negotiations to find some response to the recent horrors in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, N.Y., left few lawmakers with much hope that Congress would produce anything meaningful.

''Please, please, please, damn it, put yourselves in the shoes of these parents for once,'' Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, pleaded with his Republican colleagues, as he made the case for at least expanding background checks on gun purchasers.

Polls show that the proposal has support from as many as 90 percent of Americans, including many G.O.P. voters, but Republicans have effectively blocked action on it for the better part of a decade. Their stance reflects the potency of the issue of gun rights for the Republican base voters, whose zeal for the 2nd Amendment means that any G.O.P. lawmaker who embraces even the most modest form of gun control runs the risk of a primary challenge that could cost him his job.

Still, after Mr. Schumer initially cleared the way for a quick vote to put Republicans on the spot on background checks, he pulled back on Wednesday and said there was no point in doing so, given that their opposition was already ''crystal clear.'' Instead, he said he would try to find a consensus proposal that could draw in enough Republicans to break the inevitable filibuster.",1622,272

The motive for Tuesday's attack on elementary school children in Uvalde, Texas, is still unknown. But the motive for the Buffalo attack appears clear from the online screed left by the shooting suspect. Influenced by the so-called great replacement theory, he sought to kill as many Black people as he could. Ten died.

This is terrorism by definition: the use of violence to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or influence government policy. In the United States, it is often accomplished using semiautomatic weapons.

Permissive gun laws and easy access to firearms make the United States a prime target for firearms-based terrorist attacks like the one in Buffalo. They subject the population to the constant threat of mass shootings like the one in Uvalde, where 19 children and two teachers were fatally shot. Whether that shooting ultimately meets the statutory definition of terrorism or not, it certainly has terrified people nationwide, raising fears yet again that children are at risk, even in their schools, from a violence abetted by the ready availability of semiautomatic weapons.

Victor Escalon, a regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, gave a new timeline of how the now-deceased gunman, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, walked into Robb Elementary School, barricaded himself in a classroom and killed 19 children and two teachers.

Mr. Escalon said he couldn't say why no one stopped Ramos from entering the school during that time Tuesday. Most of the shots Ramos fired came during the first several minutes after he entered the school, Mr. Escalon said.

People who arrived at the school while Ramos locked himself in a classroom, or who saw videos of police waiting outside, were furious.

""The police were doing nothing,"" said Angeli Rose Gomez, who after learning about the shooting drove 40 miles to Robb Elementary, where her children are in second and third grade. ""They were just standing outside the fence. They weren't going in there or running anywhere.""",1168,191

Was that it? Was Salvador Ramos evil? Or was he an unhappy young man who stuttered, had a lisp, was bullied and mocked by the other students and came from a dysfunctional home with a mother who used drugs? Why do people do these things? Because they are unhappy? Because they are crazy? Or can it be that they are, in truth . . . evil? Evil is a very big word.

Writing in Time magazine about the slaughter of 16 schoolchildren and a teacher in Dunblane, Scotland, 26 years ago, I called it an evil act; I said that the shooter himself, a man named Hamilton, was evil. A medical doctor, a civilized man, wrote to me saying that I was stupid to use such a medieval word as evil. Clearly, said the doctor, the man who shot the children was mentally ill. I felt chastened.

On the other hand, why not use a medieval word like evil? Things have only gotten worse since Dunblane. I sometimes think that the 21st century, by a trick of time and physics that we don't yet understand, has been caught in an undertow. We are being drawn back toward something primitive and indeed medieval, as if the most impressive scientific and technological progress were being matched by an equal and opposite regression.

Salvador means ""savior,"" quite a name for a killer of children. But what does it matter whether we say that he was evil?",1452,262

A spokesman for Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms Inc., said on Twitter that the communications were private messages, not public posts.

Ramos ultimately barricaded himself in a two-room fourth-grade classroom that all of the victims shared, law-enforcement officials said, and was killed there Tuesday after a shootout with an elite team of Border Patrol agents.

Democratic Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke called on Mr. Abbott not to attend. ""Governor Abbott, if you have any decency, you will immediately withdraw from this weekend's NRA convention and urge them to hold it anywhere but Texas,"" he tweeted.

In one encouraging sign for the talks, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) told reporters Thursday that he had directed Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) to meet with Democrats to see if an agreement can be reached. He didn't indicate what kind of legislation he might back.

""I am hopeful that we could come up with a bipartisan solution that's directly related to the facts of this awful massacre,"" Mr. McConnell said. ""I'm going to keep in touch with them, and hopefully, we can get an outcome that can actually pass and become law rather than just scoring points back and forth.""

Many Democrats have been focused on gun restrictions in the wake of the latest school shooting, while Republicans have emphasized school safety measures. But some areas of potential compromise exist, including so-called red-flag laws, expanded background checks and more mental-health resources. Red-flag laws, which are in place in some states, allow courts to temporarily take guns from people deemed dangerous.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has backed efforts by Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) to hold talks with Republicans over the Memorial Day recess. In the 50-50 Senate, Democrats would need at least 10 GOP votes to advance any legislation if they remained united.",1569,251

With the current death toll, Tuesday's shooting is the deadliest at a U.S. school since the one in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where 20 children and six staff members died. In 2018, an attack at a high school in Parkland, Fla., left 17 students and staff dead.
