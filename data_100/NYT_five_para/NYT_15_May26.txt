A day after the massacre in Uvalde, Tex., parents and caregivers agonized over the safety of America's children.

Late Tuesday night, Luz Belliard sat on the edge of her bed in Upper Manhattan in the room she shares with her 9-year-old granddaughter, Victoria, and thought about what to say.
Victoria, a third grader, was sitting on her own bed, which was covered in stuffed animals; she had already seen on the evening news that children her age had been killed in a mass shooting at a school in Texas.

Now, Ms. Belliard had to consider just what she would tell Victoria on their walk to school the next morning: Listen to your teachers. Get down on the floor. Remember the drills you do in class.

''She's young, but she understands -- sometimes too much,'' Ms. Belliard said Wednesday outside of Victoria's school, P.S. 4 Duke Ellington in Washington Heights. ''To take your child to school, and then come back to see them dead, it's not fair. It should not be that way.''
