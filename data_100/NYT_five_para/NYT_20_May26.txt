An attack at a Buffalo supermarket. A California church pierced by gunfire. And now 19 elementary school students killed in Uvalde, Texas.

The repetition of horror numbs the mind: Only 11 days ago there was Buffalo, with a man driven by racism gunning down 10 people at a supermarket. The next day another angry man walked into a Presbyterian church in Laguna Woods, Calif., and killed one person and wounded five others. And now, Uvalde, Texas -- a repeat of what was once thought unfathomable: the killing of at least 19 elementary school children in second, third and fourth grades.
''I guess it's something in society we know will happen again, over and over,'' said Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son, Jesse Lewis, died in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012.

The misery mounts, and yet nothing changes, leaving Americans with little more to do than keep lists, mental spreadsheets of death that treat events like Uvalde as just another morbid tally with superlatives like ''second-deadliest shooting in an elementary school.''

Each event evokes some atrocity from the past, the exact details of each shooting growing more indistinct by the year: The latest death toll of 21 at Robb Elementary School in Texas surpasses the shooting in Parkland, Fla., in 2018, when 17 people were killed. It falls short of the deadliest school shooting -- 26 people killed at Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.
