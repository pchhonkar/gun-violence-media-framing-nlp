For more than a decade, as mass shooting has followed mass shooting in the United States, Democrats in Congress have proposed gun restrictions to try to prevent the next tragedy, hoping that the fresh outrage and anguish of another massacre would finally yield some consensus.
Each time -- after gun massacres at concerts, grocery stores, a Bible study and, most wrenchingly, elementary schools -- they have failed amid Republican opposition.

''We have these truly horrific moments, and then it seems like very little happens because of Republicans in Congress doing the gun lobby's bidding,'' said Robin Lloyd, the managing director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

''We have had the biggest challenges in getting something done at the federal level,'' she added, noting that there has been more action in the states, with more than 450 pieces of legislation signed into law since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

Here is a look at a decade's worth of failed efforts in Congress to address gun violence after mass shootings.
