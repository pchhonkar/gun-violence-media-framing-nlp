Bags packed for a long overdue vacation, I saw the first reports: ''Latest mass shooting'' does not narrow it down as much as one would like, and that is exactly the problem.

Three days ago, I would have been talking about the murder of 10 people in a Buffalo grocery store. Today, I am talking about the 19 dead students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas -- one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. The adjectives are shorthand for our sins.

Two weeks ago, politicians decried peaceful protests at the homes of Supreme Court justices as unseemly and dangerous. It took Congress mere days from the leak of a draft opinion to pass a law granting justices additional security. A few hours after the shooting, Texas Republicans suggested arming teachers at schools. It is the kind of unserious proposal that young children offer for solving world hunger. ''Just drop a big wheel of cheese from the sky!''

Not to make light of teachers, but mine used to fuss in the hallways about dragging the multimedia cart from room to room. It is hard to imagine my fourth-grade teacher, Mrs. Sims, armed. She wore orthopedic shoes and often lost her markers in her short cropped Afro.

Teachers with guns is a fantasy, no matter whom you cast as Mrs. Sims. Trained police officers in Uvalde were no match because the shooter had comparable weaponry. We may as well send in wheels of cheese.
