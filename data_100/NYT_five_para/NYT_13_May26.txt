After shootings, investors often anticipate appeals for tighter gun laws and an increase in sales.

The share prices of gun and ammunition companies often rise after mass shootings, with investors anticipating a spike in sales ahead of calls for stricter gun laws. On Wednesday, the day after a deadly shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, prices for major gun-related stocks rose after a subdued start.

Smith & Wesson and Vista Outdoor both increased about 7 percent, while Sturm Ruger gained more than 4 percent. The stock market overall was up about 1 percent.

''The gun industry has perverse incentives,'' said Dru Stevenson, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston, ''because sales and their stocks go up when there are events like this.''

Gun makers' shares have also generally risen since President Biden's election, as they typically do under Democratic administrations, when tougher gun control measures get more attention. ''As a nation, we have to ask, when in God's name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?'' Mr. Biden said on Tuesday, declaring that it was ''time to turn this pain into action.''
