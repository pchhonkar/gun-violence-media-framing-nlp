Hours after the worst school shooting in a decade took place in his home state, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas acknowledged that there were ''way too many of these horrific mass murders'' and suggested a possible solution: putting armed law enforcement on campuses.
Then Mr. Cruz, a Republican, quickly turned to blame Democrats and the news media for politicizing the issue.

''If you look to the past, we know what is effective, and it is targeting the felons and fugitives and the bad guys,'' Mr. Cruz told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday evening. ''But as sure as night follows day, you can bet there are going to be Democrat politicians looking to advance their own political agenda, rather than to work to stop this kind of horrific violence and to keep everyone safe.''

In the aftermath of Tuesday's school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, where an 18-year-old gunman killed 19 children and two teachers, Mr. Cruz remained unapologetic in his broad opposition to gun control measures. He reverted to a script that condemns Democrats for trying to use the issue for partisan advantage and argued that lawmakers should narrowly target the criminals who try to purchase firearms illegally.

Before the shooting, Mr. Cruz, who received an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association during his 2018 re-election bid, was scheduled to address the organization on Friday at its convention in Houston. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz did not respond when asked if he still planned to attend the gathering.
