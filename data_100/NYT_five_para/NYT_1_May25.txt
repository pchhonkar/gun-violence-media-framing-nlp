Elizabeth Williamson is the author of ''Sandy Hook: An American Tragedy and the Battle for Truth'' and has spent the past four years reporting on the Newtown massacre's aftermath and the families' battle against misinformation.

In 2012, the shooting of 20 first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the worst elementary school shooting in American history, dealt the nation and its leadership a profound shock.
Nearly a decade later, while watching the death toll rise after Tuesday's shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex., one father of a Sandy Hook victim felt defeated.

''I guess it's something in society we know will happen again, over and over,'' said Neil Heslin, whose son Jesse Lewis, 6, died in the shooting in 2012.

Mr. Heslin said he ''felt compelled'' to watch the coverage. ''It's almost like an instant replay of Sandy Hook,'' he said.
