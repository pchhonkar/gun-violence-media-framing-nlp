On Tuesday, an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, a rural town about 80 miles west of San Antonio, killing 19 children and two teachers, and wounding several other children.
While the community grapples with the aftermath, which took place as students and teachers were preparing to start summer break this week, local leaders and organizations have mobilized. Two local funeral homes, Hillcrest Memorial Funeral Home and Rushing-Estes-Knowles Mortuary, said in social media posts that they would not charge families of victims for their funeral services.

Here are some ways to help:

GoFundMe has established a hub where those who want to give money can safely donate to verified fund-raisers for people affected by the Robb Elementary School shooting. Among them is VictimsFirst, a network of families of the deceased and survivors of previous mass shootings.

The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District set up a donation fund at the First State Bank of Uvalde for the families of the victims. Donations can sent by check or through Zelle, the money-transfer app, and also may be dropped in person.
