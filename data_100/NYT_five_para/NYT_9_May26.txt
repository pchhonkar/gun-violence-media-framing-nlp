Joseph R. Biden Jr. responded to the slaughter of 20 elementary school children by declaring: ''The world has changed, and it's demanding action.''
That was almost 10 years ago.

When 19 more children were killed by a gunman in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, Mr. Biden, now the president, repeated his own call for the government to do something, decrying ''another massacre'' and insisting that it was ''time to turn this pain into action.''

But a decade after Republicans blocked gun safety legislation in response to the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Biden remains caught between a desire to honor the dead by vowing to act and the reality that he cannot deliver on sweeping promises without consensus in Congress.

Mr. Biden said on Wednesday that he would visit Uvalde in the coming days, saying that ''the idea that an 18-year-old can walk into a store and buy weapons of war designed and marketed to kill is, I think, just wrong.''
