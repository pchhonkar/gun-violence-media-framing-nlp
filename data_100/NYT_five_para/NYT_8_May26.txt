The massacre in Texas cast a pall over confirmation hearings on Wednesday for Steven Dettelbach, President Biden's pick to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, but it may have improved his chances of being confirmed.

White House officials considered the hearings a make-or-break moment for Mr. Biden's stalled agenda on gun control, which hinges on an energized and forcefully led A.T.F. With unanimous Republican opposition expected, they cannot afford a single Democratic defection in an evenly divided Senate.

That already unpredictable dynamic was upended less than 24 hours before Mr. Dettelbach appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, when an 18-year-old man wielded a semiautomatic rifle to kill 19 school children, a teacher and another adult at a school in the town of Uvalde.

But the shock over the killings seemed to have jolted, at least for a day, momentum in Mr. Dettelbach's direction: Republicans, who had been expected to grill him over his previous support for a renewal of the federal assault weapons ban, adopted a notably less confrontational tone than they did in their harsh questioning of David Chipman, the administration's first pick, whose nomination was ultimately withdrawn.

The most pointed exchange came when Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas and a supporter of gun rights, questioned Mr. Dettelbach, a veteran federal prosecutor in Ohio, over his support for an assault weapons ban, a position Mr. Dettelbach promoted during an unsuccessful bid for Ohio attorney general in 2018.
