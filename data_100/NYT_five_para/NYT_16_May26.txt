For Republicans, brandishing firepower is a visual shorthand for hard-core conservatism. Democrats see little gain in highlighting an issue on which their party hasn't been able to get much done.

In Alabama, Gov. Kay Ivey unpacked lipstick, an iPhone and something else from her purse in one campaign advertisement -- ''a little Smith & Wesson .38,'' she said. A Republican candidate for governor in Georgia declared in a different spot, ''I believe in Jesus, guns and babies.''

In Nevada, an ad for former Senator Dean Heller, now a Republican candidate for governor, bragged about his wife's shooting skills. And in North Carolina, a spot for Representative Ted Budd, a Republican Senate candidate, boasted that he owned a gun range.

As the nation reels from a massacre at a Texas elementary school in which a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers, a review of Republican and Democratic advertising during the first months of 2022 highlights the giant cultural chasm over guns in America. As both parties have navigated their respective primary seasons, Republicans have been far more likely to use messaging about guns to galvanize their base in the midterms than Democrats -- who are largely in agreement on the issue of combating gun violence, but have seen one legislative effort after another collapse.

Since January, fewer than two dozen television ads from Democratic candidates and their aligned groups mention guns or combating gun violence, according to a review of data through Tuesday from the media tracking firm AdImpact.
