A shaken and emotional President Biden declared that it is ''time to turn this pain into action'' Tuesday night as he addressed the nation following the slaughter of 18 elementary school children and a teacher in Texas.
''It's just sick,'' he said of the sorts of weapons that are easily available in the United States.

Mr. Biden spoke for just seven minutes, giving voice to the grief and anger and frustration of many Americans, asking: ''Why? Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen?''

The president took direct aim at gun manufacturers and their representatives in Washington, urging politicians to stand up to the power they wield. But he made no specific gun control proposals nor called on Congress to vote immediately on legislation.

''The gun manufacturers have spent two decades aggressively marketing assault weapons, which make them the most and largest profit,'' Mr. Biden said. ''For God's sake, we have to have the courage to stand up to the industry.''
