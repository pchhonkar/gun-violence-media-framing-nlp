Nineteen children and two adults were killed in a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, Tuesday in what is now the second deadliest school shooting in the US.

The 18-year-old shooter, identified by officials as Salvador Ramos, was shot and killed by responding law enforcement. He arrived at Robb Elementary School with a long rifle and wearing body armor, according to Sgt. Erick Estrada with the Texas Department of Public Safety.
The school teaches second through fourth grades and had 535 students in the 2020-21 school year, according to state data.

Hours after the shooting Tuesday, parents were desperately waiting at a civic center near the school to find out if their children had survived. Some told CNN they gave their DNA to help identify the victims.

Here's what we know about the shooting, which happened two days before summer break.
