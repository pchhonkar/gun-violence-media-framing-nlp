Yeezy Gap has postponed the launch of its Balenciaga collection following the deadly shooting at a Texas elementary school.

The company posted a message on its website Wednesday morning: "In light of the tragedy in Uvalde, Texas, we are postponing the Yeezy Gap Engineered by Balenciaga launch until Friday, May 27. As we pause, our hearts go out to the families and communities impacted."

An 18-year-old gunman on Tuesday fatally shot 19 children and two adults at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, before he was killed by law enforcement officers, officials said.

Tuesday's massacre is the second-deadliest school shooting since 2012, when 26 children and adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It is at least the 30th shooting at a K-12 school in 2022, according to a CNN tally.
