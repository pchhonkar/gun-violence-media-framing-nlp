Two days before the start of summer break, an 18-year-old man opened fire at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, killing 14 students and one teacher, Gov. Greg Abbott said.

The alleged shooter, who also died, is believed to have shot his grandmother before going to the school, three law enforcement sources told CNN.

Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District police Chief Pete Arredondo said the gunman is believed to have acted alone. Arredondo declined to provide further details or take questions from reporters.

The suspected shooter was identified as Salvador Ramos, of Uvalde, according to officials.

"It's believed that he abandoned his vehicle and entered into the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde with a handgun and he may have also had a rifle, but that is not yet confirmed according to my most recent report. He shot and killed, horrifically, incomprehensively, 14 students and killed a teacher," he said.
