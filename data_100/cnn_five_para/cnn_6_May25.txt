Just two days before students in a Texas elementary school were set to begin their summer break, a gunman clad in body armor rushed his way into the school and opened fire on classrooms of young children, killing 19 students and two adults, officials said.

The violent act shook a nation already reeling from another mass shooting across the country just 10 days ago. Parents waited late into the night at a nearby civic center to learn whether their children had survived, with some telling CNN they had to give DNA samples to assist authorities in identifying children.
The 18-year-old gunman, who was killed by law enforcement, is believed to have shot his grandmother before driving to the school to carry out to attack, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.

As he tried to enter the school, he was engaged by school district police officers, but was still able to enter the building and go into multiple classrooms, DPS Sgt. Erick Estrada said. Authorities say he was armed with a rifle and carrying a backpack.

Tuesday's tragic event marks the deadliest school shooting in nearly a decade since 26 children and adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. It is also at least the 30th shooting at a K-12 school in 2022, according to a CNN tally.
