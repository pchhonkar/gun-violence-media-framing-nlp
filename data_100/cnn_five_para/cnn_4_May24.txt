Eighteen children and one adult were killed in Tuesday's mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, according to Sgt. Erick Estrada of the Texas Department of Public Safety.
Estrada did not provide any other information on the victims.

Gov. Greg Abbott said earlier Tuesday "it is believed" that the shooter, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, was killed by law enforcement. Estrada confirmed the suspect was killed.

Ramos is believed to have shot his grandmother before going to the school, three law enforcement sources told CNN.

Two days before the start of summer break, an 18-year-old man opened fire at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, killing 14 students and one teacher, Gov. Greg Abbott said.
