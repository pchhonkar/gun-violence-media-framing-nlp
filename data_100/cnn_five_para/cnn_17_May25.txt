The suspect who killed 19 kids and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, was a local high school student with few if any friends who officials said legally purchased two assault rifles and scores of ammo last week for his 18th birthday.

Salvador Ramos was identified as the gunman who stormed into Robb Elementary on Tuesday with an assault rifle and tactical vest, barricaded himself in a classroom of children and opened fire. Responding officers eventually forced their way into the room and fatally shot him.

The heinous attack came just two days before students were set to be released for the summer and left a community and nation asking yet again: Who would do this, and why?

An examination of Ramos' personal background reveals a bullied loner with no criminal history and -- like so many other mass shooters in America -- interest in and access to high-powered firearms and ammunition.

He purchased guns and ammo last week

The suspect's actions leading up to the shooting offer hints at his mindset and plan.
