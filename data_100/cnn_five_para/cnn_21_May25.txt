When Democrat Beto O'Rourke confronted Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott during a press conference Wednesday in the wake of a mass school shooting that left 19 children and two adults dead, he was shouted down for making the tragedy political.

"There are family members who are crying as we speak, there are family members whose hearts are broken, there is no words that anybody shouting can come up here and do anything to heal those broken hearts," said Abbott. "We all, every Texan, every American has the responsibility. We need to focus not on ourselves and our agendas."
This is, of course, the common response when these events happen. Politicians -- usually Republicans -- insist that it's not the time to discuss gun-related public policies after a mass shooting. And that anyone who does so is somehow dishonoring the memories of those who have been lost.

It's time -- actually past time -- to put that way of thinking behind us.

This is not to defend or criticize what O'Rourke did. It is impossible to separate out the fact that he is running against Abbott this year from his decision to confront the governor at a moment when he knew the eyes of Texas and the nation would be on him.
