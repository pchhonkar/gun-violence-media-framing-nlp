Kaitlin Marie Armstrong, the woman suspected of fatally shooting elite cyclist Anna Moriah "Mo" Wilson in Texas, is believed to have traveled to New York City after the killing, authorities said Wednesday.

Armstrong, 34, accused in the May 11 shooting of Wilson -- who had previously dated Armstrong's boyfriend -- in what investigators believe may have been a deadly act of romantic jealousy. A homicide warrant was issued for Armstrong on May 17.

On the night of the killing, Wilson was staying at a friend's house in Austin in preparation for a race, according to an arrest affidavit filed by police in Travis County District Court.

Officers went to the home shortly before 10 p.m. to find Wilson suffering from gunshot wounds, according to police. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Surveillance video shows a vehicle like Armstrong's near the scene of the shooting, according to the affidavit.
