House Sergeant at Arms William J. Walker, one of the top security officials on Capitol Hill, revealed that he does not believe lawmakers should be allowed to carry firearms in the US Capitol Complex, in a new letter provided exclusively to CNN.

"It is my view that the Capitol Complex should be a place where no one carries a firearm unless they are actively engaged in law enforcement or the protection work done by, among others, myself, the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) the U.S. Secret Service, and the protective details of visiting foreign officials" Walker wrote.
Walker's comments come one day after a gunman murdered 21 people in a Texas elementary school. It letter was prompted by an April letter from Democratic House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who asked Walker for clarity on whether the US Capitol could be made a "gun-free zone" with the exception of security personnel.

While firearms are prohibited in the Capitol Complex for most individuals, lawmakers are allowed to carry firearms in office buildings if they are licensed in the District of Columbia. Certain areas however are restricted, such as the House floor.

Walker acknowledged in his letter that his position that lawmakers should be prohibited from carrying firearms in general is not a commonly held belief.
