President Joe Biden's nominee to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives vowed he would not be influenced by political considerations if he secures the job at a Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday with the nation's attention focused on gun violence after a horrific shooting at a Texas elementary school.

An 18-year-old gunman on Tuesday fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school before he was killed by law enforcement officers, officials said. It is the deadliest shooting at a school since the Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut in 2012 that left 26 people dead, including 20 children aged between 6 and 7 years old.
The tragedy has shocked the nation and ratcheted up the pressure on Congress and the President to take action, though Democrats can do little to pass stricter gun control measures in a 50-50 Senate amid widespread Republican opposition.

Against that backdrop, the Senate Judiciary Committee is considering the nomination of Steve Dettelbach to run the ATF during a hearing on Wednesday.

In remarks before the committee, Dettelbach addressed the school shooting, calling the pain the families and the community now feel "unimaginable."
