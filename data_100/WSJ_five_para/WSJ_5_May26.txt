Democratic lawmakers raged at the lack of action on gun legislation but Senate leaders held off on any new votes in the wake of the Texas school shooting, as even proposals with some Republicans support such as red-flag laws continued to face long odds.

In remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) conceded that there is no obvious path forward for gun measures and made no immediate plans to put a vote on the floor, as he pointed a finger at his GOP colleagues, whom he accused of being at the service of pro-gun groups. In the 50-50 Senate, a united Democratic caucus would need GOP support to reach the 60 votes needed to advance legislation.
"It's unacceptable that there are not 10 members of the Republican caucus willing to save lives, find a way to do it. And yet, that's where we are," Mr. Schumer said. He said he was open to negotiating with Republicans, but the Senate would vote on gun measures after Memorial Day recess, even without a deal.

Many Republicans rejected any push for new gun laws, calling them ineffectual, and said Democrats were trying to score political points.

"I'm very sorry it happened," said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R., Ala.). "Guns are not the problem. People are the problem."
