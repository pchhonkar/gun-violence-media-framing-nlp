Schools around the country say they are tightening campus security in the wake of the mass shooting that claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas.

School officials say they are seeking to protect students and staff and to reassure families that classrooms are safe. This week, districts added police on campuses, banned backpacks and required guests to call ahead, even as the end of the instructional year approaches.
Some school-security professionals question whether the reactive responses help prevent future violence. With each new tragedy, parents and security professionals say, a familiar cycle typically occurs: an immediate vow to improve security, followed by waning attention.

Nevertheless, even as school leaders realize they can't minimize all risks, schools feel compelled to act. "This tragedy puts us all in the position of revisiting topics and asking the tough questions all over again," said Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho.

Details continued to emerge Friday about the timeline of events that led to the massacre in Uvalde.
