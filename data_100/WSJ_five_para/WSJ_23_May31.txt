Rolando Rodriguez had few words to describe how he was feeling as he turned out Monday to some of the first of the funeral events for the 21 victims, including his grandson, gunned down in their elementary school last week.

"I wouldn't wish this on anyone," Mr. Rodriguez said, calling his 10-year-old grandson, Jose Manuel Flores Jr., a good boy who loved baseball, fishing and spending time with family.
Funeral events began in Uvalde on Monday, the final day of a scorching holiday weekend marked by anger and despair, as townspeople continued to grapple with the impact of the violence and unanswered questions surrounding the law-enforcement response to the shooting. Local police and other law enforcement waited outside the doors of a barricaded two-room fourth-grade classroom for more than an hour, despite repeated 911 calls from children inside begging for help, according to a timeline laid out by the Texas Department of Public Safety on Friday.

Ultimately, 19 children and two teachers were killed.

On Monday, the city was jammed with people. Throngs of well-wishers from Uvalde and out-of-town seemed to use the holiday weekend to visit the several makeshift memorials that have sprung up downtown and near Robb Elementary School, the site of the massacre. Restaurants reported hours-long waits for food. Law-enforcement vehicles from throughout the state meandered through downtown, while others were stationed outside business or homes of those involved in the incident.
