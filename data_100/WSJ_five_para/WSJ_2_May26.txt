The Border Patrol agent who killed the mass shooter at an elementary school here Tuesday belonged to a small, elite team that has a presence in this town and responded to calls about the incident on local police radio.

The agent and two colleagues who confronted the shooter belong to the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, known as Bortac. Its roughly 240 agents are among the most highly trained in federal law enforcement. They do some of the Patrol's riskiest work, including storming migrant stash houses.
They were among about 80 Border Patrol agents who ultimately responded to the massacre in which 19 students and two teachers died, according to an agency official. Many of them live and work in Uvalde.

Initially, the Bortac agents couldn't get into the classroom where the shooter locked himself because of a steel door and cinder block construction.

The agents got a master key from the principal and entered the room, the officials said. One Bortac agent took rounds to their shield upon entering and a second was wounded by shrapnel. A third killed the suspect.
