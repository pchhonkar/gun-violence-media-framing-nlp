The gunman who killed 19 students and two teachers in an elementary school here had a confrontation with an armed security guard before getting into the building and sent a private Facebook message about his intention to commit the mass shooting minutes before driving there, officials said Wednesday.

Salvador Ramos, 18 years old, wrote on Facebook Tuesday morning to a teenage girl overseas that he was going to shoot his grandmother, and then said he had shot her after doing so, according to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and a law-enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. Less than 15 minutes before arriving at Robb Elementary School, he wrote that he was going to go "shoot up an elementary school," the officials said.
A spokesman for Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms Inc., said on Twitter that the communications were private messages, not public posts.

Ramos ultimately barricaded himself in a two-room fourth-grade classroom that all of the victims shared, law-enforcement officials said, and was killed there Tuesday after a shootout with an elite team of Border Patrol agents.

"Evil swept through Uvalde yesterday," Mr. Abbott said Wednesday of the attack, which is the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. this year.
