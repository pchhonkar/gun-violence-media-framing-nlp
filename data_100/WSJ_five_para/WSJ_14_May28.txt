Police who responded to the mass shooting at an elementary school here waited around an hour to enter the classroom where the gunman had locked himself because a commander on scene incorrectly thought no lives were at risk despite multiple 911 calls from children inside, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety said Friday.

The decision was a mistake and it is unclear how many lives it may have cost, said the director, Steven McCraw, at a news conference. Ultimately 19 children and two teachers were found dead.
The first 911 call regarding the shooter came in at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, minutes before local police arrived and the shooter barricaded himself inside two connected fourth-grade classrooms at Robb Elementary School, Mr. McCraw said. From 12:03 to 12:46, he added, 911 dispatchers received numerous calls from within the classroom, including repeated calls from a child whispering that people were dead and begging: "Please send the police now."

Meanwhile, at least 19 law-enforcement officers waited in the hallway, because the commander on scene, the school district's chief of police, believed no lives were at risk and it was better to wait until a tactical team could get keys to the room before entering, according to Mr. McCraw. A Border Patrol tactical team ultimately did so, and killed the shooter, at 12:50 p.m., he said.

"The on scene commander at that time believed it had transitioned from an active shooter to a barricaded subject," Mr. McCraw said. "Obviously, based upon the information we have, children in that classroom were at risk, and it was in fact still an active shooter . . . It was the wrong decision. Period."
