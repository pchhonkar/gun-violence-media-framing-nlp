An 18-year-old man opened fire in an elementary school here Tuesday, killing at least 19 students and two adults, including a teacher, before he was killed by law enforcement, officials said.

Police identified the gunman as Salvador Ramos, a resident of Uvalde, where the school is located. Uvalde, a city of around 16,000, is about 80 miles west of San Antonio.
Ramos, a former student at Uvalde High School, shot his grandmother before going to Robb Elementary School, police said. He used two assault-style rifles purchased at a local gun store within a week of his 18th birthday, according to a law-enforcement official briefed on the investigation.

Two police officers who responded to the scene were shot but are expected to survive, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said.

"What happened in Uvalde is a horrific tragedy that cannot be tolerated in the state of Texas," said Mr. Abbott, a Republican.
