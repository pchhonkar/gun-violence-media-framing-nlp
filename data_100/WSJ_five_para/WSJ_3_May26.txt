Democratic and Republican lawmakers opened talks on possible legislation to address mass shootings, with enhanced background checks and red-flag laws seen as potential areas of compromise following the killing of 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.

In one encouraging sign for the talks, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) told reporters Thursday that he had directed Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) to meet with Democrats to see if an agreement can be reached. He didn't indicate what kind of legislation he might back.
"I am hopeful that we could come up with a bipartisan solution that's directly related to the facts of this awful massacre," Mr. McConnell said. "I'm going to keep in touch with them, and hopefully, we can get an outcome that can actually pass and become law rather than just scoring points back and forth."

Many Democrats have been focused on gun restrictions in the wake of the latest school shooting, while Republicans have emphasized school safety measures. But some areas of potential compromise exist, including so-called red-flag laws, expanded background checks and more mental-health resources. Red-flag laws, which are in place in some states, allow courts to temporarily take guns from people deemed dangerous.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has backed efforts by Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) to hold talks with Republicans over the Memorial Day recess. In the 50-50 Senate, Democrats would need at least 10 GOP votes to advance any legislation if they remained united.
