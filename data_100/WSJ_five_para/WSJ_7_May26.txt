The National Rifle Association's annual meeting is set to begin Friday in Houston, days after the deadly school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, drawing criticism from gun-control advocates and others.

Former President Donald Trump, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) are scheduled to speak at the three-day meeting.
  "As we gather in Houston, we will reflect on these events, pray for the victims, recognize our patriotic members and pledge to redouble our commitment to making our schools secure," the NRA said Wednesday.

Democratic Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke called on Mr. Abbott not to attend. "Governor Abbott, if you have any decency, you will immediately withdraw from this weekend's NRA convention and urge them to hold it anywhere but Texas," he tweeted.

The offices of Messrs. Abbott, Trump and Cruz didn't respond to requests to comment.
