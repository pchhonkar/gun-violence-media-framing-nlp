In the near-decade since a 20-year-old with an assault-style rifle rampaged through a Connecticut elementary school, advocates for tighter gun control have mobilized to counter the influence of the National Rifle Association.

Mass shootings in the past two weeks at a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y., and an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, have sent a surge in donations to gun-control groups as they renew calls for more federal restrictions on gun ownership.
Yet the leaders say they have little to show for their recent efforts in Washington.

"We've had very few concrete wins," said Robin Lloyd, managing director of Giffords, a group advocating for gun safety that sprang from the 2011 shooting in Arizona that targeted then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

Gun-control activists say they haven't succeeded because of the nearly unified opposition of Republican lawmakers, who say more restrictions aren't the way to reduce violence and may violate the Second Amendment. Their side also remains vastly outspent on lobbying by gun-rights groups, despite funding from the likes of billionaire Michael Bloomberg. And Democratic politicians acknowledge that pro-gun voters place a higher priority on the issue than voters who favor gun control.
