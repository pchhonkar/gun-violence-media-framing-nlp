Rojelio Torres rose each day at 5:30 a.m. to get ready to go to school with his siblings in this normally sleepy town an hour from the Mexican border. Tuesday, the 10-year-old who loved to play soccer and football didn't make it back home.

Rojelio was among the 19 children killed this week at Robb Elementary School in the deadliest school shooting in a decade. His aunt, Eoudulia Orta, said from their pink family home that she knew as the hours went by on Tuesday she would have to explain to his siblings and cousins -- two of whom attended the same school -- what had happened.
"It's hard for me to tell them this, but their brother is not coming back," Ms. Orta said Wednesday. "He's with their great-grandparents." Rojelio was the second-born in the family of four children, and his youngest sibling still doesn't seem to understand that he is gone, Ms. Orta said.

When a gunman opened fire Tuesday in a classroom using a semiautomatic weapon, killing 19 children and two teachers, he sent tragedy ricocheting through this community. Many sets of siblings and cousins attended Robb Elementary, which included second, third and fourth grades, in some cases causing multiple tragedies within families.

Polly Flores lost two nieces in the shooting, Jackie Cazares and Annabell Rodriguez. "My beautiful angels. At least you are together. But our hearts are broken in a million pieces," Ms. Flores wrote on her Facebook page.
