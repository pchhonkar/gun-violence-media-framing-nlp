A holiday weekend clouded by public grief over 31 people killed in recent attacks by teenage gunmen ended on Monday with focus on a perennial question: Can bitterly divided lawmakers reach any kind of accord aimed at preventing mass shootings?

Bipartisan Senate negotiators say they hope to have an outline of a gun-violence prevention package by the week of June 6, when they return from recess. President Biden on Monday expressed optimism over those talks, despite a long history of failure to find consensus.
"I think things have gotten so bad that everybody is getting more rational about it -- at least that's my hope and prayer," Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.), a top negotiator, expressed similar views a day earlier. "Every single time, after one of these mass shootings, there's talks in Washington and they never succeed," he said on ABC. "But there are more Republicans interested in talking about finding a path forward this time than I have ever seen since Sandy Hook."

Mr. Murphy said he has been in touch with Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas), who was tapped by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell to lead talks, as well as other lawmakers. "We're already having those discussions in person and on the phone," Mr. Cornyn told reporters on Monday. "Look forward to meeting on Tuesday through a Zoom call to try to see if we can agree on a basic framework about how we go forward."
