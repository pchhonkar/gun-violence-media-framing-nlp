Police have been vilified nationwide these past two years for excessive use of force, so there's no small irony in the criticism raining down on police in Uvalde, Texas, for waiting outside Robb Elementary School while Salvador Ramos was barricaded inside a classroom where he had murdered 19 children.

"The on-scene commander at that time believed it had transitioned from an active shooter to a barricaded subject," Steven McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a news conference on Friday. "Obviously, based upon the information we have, children in that classroom were at risk and it was in fact still an active shooter . . . It was the wrong decision. Period."
The anger of parents is all the more acute because police blocked at least one mother from entering the school. Another mother went in on her own and escaped with her children.

It isn't clear if charging the gunman sooner would have saved lives, but that is what we expect of law enforcement. In the event, a tactical team from Customs and Border Protection arrived, stormed the classroom, and killed Ramos. One of the agents was grazed in the head with a bullet, meaning he was a half-inch away from death.

No doubt police everywhere are asking themselves how they would behave under such circumstances. But the terror in Uvalde is a reminder that, especially in these days of violence, we need the bravest to take those risks. And we need to give them the training, and the public support, to do so.
