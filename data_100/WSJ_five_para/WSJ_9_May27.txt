The killing of 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde Texas, makes this year the third most deadly for active school-shooter events going back to 1970. Since then, 188 people have been killed in school shootings.

With the current death toll, Tuesday's shooting is the deadliest at a U.S. school since the one in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where 20 children and six staff members died. In 2018, an attack at a high school in Parkland, Fla., left 17 students and staff dead.
There has been a school shooting every year during the past 40 years, except for 2020, when most schools didn't meet in person because of the pandemic.
