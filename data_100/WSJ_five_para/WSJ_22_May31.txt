A crippling fallacy that characterizes our modern media is the idea that every event that rises to the level of news must connote some wider societal or political crisis that can only be remedied by government intervention.

Tragedies, natural disasters, acts of unspeakable evil aren't simply to be reported and explained for what they often are: the products of individual will or negligence, irremediable human malignity or some complex set of scientific interactions. Instead each event -- from lethal accidents to vicious murders to Category 5 hurricanes -- is immediately sorted into its prelabeled moral narrative file, each one full of similarly useful sententious parables.
They become props in the larger drama that is being constantly written for us by the preachy puritans who now control most news organizations, convenient plot devices to illustrate the virtue of their cause and the malevolence of that of their critics.

The mass murder of happy fourth graders and teachers celebrating the last few days of the school year in a Texas border town could almost stand as the definition of an inexplicable act of a single mind gone catastrophically astray. There's a vast literature on the psychology of mass shootings. With each new atrocity we get a more nuanced understanding of the pathology that yields it. But there's no elementary causal accounting for why some young men's moral compass has been so corrupted that they think it legitimate, or even heroic, to shed the innocent blood of small children.

We all grasp that. But the unfathomable isn't something our media masters can tolerate. An unsurpassing self-assurance in their own moral and intellectual wisdom isn't allowed to be punctured by the complex inexplicability of the real world. So to maintain the patina of omniscience they must fit the story into one of their narratives. It ceases to be a complex act of mental derangement and becomes instead simply a blindingly obvious case.
