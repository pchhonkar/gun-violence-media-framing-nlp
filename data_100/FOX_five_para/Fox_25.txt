The religious freedom firm First Liberty sent a letter Tuesday to the City of Palatka, Florida, defending the use ofpublic funds to restore a church's Olympic-sized pool after a secularist group claimed the move would violate the First Amendment'sEstablishment Clause.

"The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution permits religious organizations to receive generallyavailable government benefits like the funds at issue here," Keisha Russell and Ryan Gardner, lawyers with the firm First LibertyInstitute, wrote in the letter, provided to Fox News Digital. 

"Moveover, the Free Exercise Clause forbids the type of religious discrimination proposed by [the Freedom From ReligionFoundation] FFRF whereby otherwise qualified religious organizations would be excluded because of their religious character oridentity," they added in the letter.

The First Liberty lawyers represent Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, which recently applied for a $35,000 grant to restore theindoor, junior Olympic swimming pool located in its Family Life Center in order to reopen the pool freely for the community's use andenjoyment.
