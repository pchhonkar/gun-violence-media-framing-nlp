Former Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway discussed Vice President Kamala Harris addressing America after the tragedy at RobbElementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and how President Biden should respond Tuesday on "Jesse Watters Primetime."

KELLYANNE CONWAY: The president has a very high bar tonight because right now the country doesn't have faith in him. Theydon't think he's competent. They don't think he's compassionate. So he really needs to pull deeply, I think be more Sen. Joe Bidenthan President Joe Biden, who is much more congenial, much more, I think, bipartisan, when he needed to be and to understandthat presidents, as President Trump did when Parkland happened on Valentine's Day that year, you have to first show the empathythat you're grieving with the community. 

TEXAS SCHOOL SHOOTING: LIVE UPDATES

You've called the governor and local officials. You're thanking the first responders, the teachers, the parents. Nothing can ever bringyour children back. You have to really dig deeply. But the other thing that President Trump said that I think is important is the resolveof what the federal government can do and cannot do. So we're going to work with the state and local authorities. We're going towork with the attorneys general. You're going to get to the root causes of what happened here.
