President Biden incorrectly blamed "the gun lobby" for the Uvalde, Texas school shooting, former Secret Service Agent DanBongino said, while correspondent-at-large Geraldo Rivera posited Americans who aren't old enough to buy alcohol shouldn't beallowed to purchase rifles.

The suspect in the shooting, Salvador Ramos, was 18.

Bongino told "Hannity" on Tuesday that Biden proved it is already too late not to politicize tragedy, saying the president's nighttimeremarks could've been a healing moment, but were instead another example of intentional division.

"In a moment where he could have been a great healer and unifier, he chose that moment to start screaming at Americans and thegun lobby who had nothing to do with," he said, noting oft-invoked public advocacy groups like the Virginia-based National RifleAssociation were not involved in the attack despite politicized suggestions to the contrary.

U.S. President Joe Biden makes a statement about the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas shortly after Biden returned to Washington from his trip to South Korea and Japan, at the White House in Washington, U.S. May 24, 2022.
