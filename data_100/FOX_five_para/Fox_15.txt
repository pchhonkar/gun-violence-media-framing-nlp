President Biden spent only a few seconds at the beginning of his remarks responding to the Uvalde, Texas school shooting beforedetouring into a political exploitation of the tragedy, independent journalist Glenn Greenwald told Fox News on Tuesday.

Greenwald noted how Biden began with a proper, emotional response to the tragic loss of life, but quickly pivoted to blaming the"gun lobby" for the mass shooting allegedly committed by now-deceased suspect Salvador Ramos.

"As a nation we have to ask when are we going to stand up to the gun lobby – when in God's name are we going to do what weknow needs to be done?" Biden fumed.

On "Tucker Carlson Tonight," Greenwald said Biden began to express how he sadly could twofold empathize with parents forced tobury a child – referencing the loss of daughter Naomi and first wife Neilia Hunter Biden in a 1972 Hockessin, Del. car wreck -- anddecades later losing his eldest son Joseph Biden III to cancer.
